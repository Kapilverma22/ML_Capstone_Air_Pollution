## ML_Capstone_Air_Pollution


Business Problem Statement
The dataset provided aims to facilitate a comprehensive analysis and the development of mitigation strategies for air pollution in the United States. With growing concerns for environmental health and air quality, understanding pollution trends and their impacts across different regions is crucial. This dataset focuses on key pollutants such as Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Ozone (O3) to aid in the formulation of targeted environmental policies and health advisories.

Background
Amidst increasing environmental concerns, there is a pressing need for an in-depth analysis of pollution trends and their impacts across various regions of the United States. This dataset provides a detailed analysis of air quality in the U.S. from 2000 to 2022. The data is primarily sourced from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with additional enhancements by Kagglers BrendaSo and ANGELA KIM.

Scope
This dataset encompasses an extensive analysis of air quality in the United States, focusing on key pollutants such as Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Ozone (O3). Covering the period from 2000 to 2022, it offers insights into pollution levels across various states, counties, and cities.
